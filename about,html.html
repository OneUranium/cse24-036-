    <P>Hello my name is One , i'm a passionate cosplayer from Botswana. I've been making my own cosplay costumes for about 5 yeares now bringing many of my favourite characters to life. My journey began after seeing amazing artists cosplay characters from my favourite anime. I've had problems with looking for good inspiration for the cosplays i make for myself. </P>
    <P> Throughout my cosplaying career ive made some wonderful costumes with inspiration from many cosplayers such as famous cosplayers like Linda Le. Working with them made it possible to bring in new ideas which fellow cosplayers can use to create their costumes.</P>
    <P> On this website you will get to see a collection of my work this incuding detailed photos too. These photos are to help you with being creative and help you in making your own wonderful cosplay. I hope my costumes get to inspire you like the characters inspire me </P>
    <p> Feel free to check out my gallery or get in touch with me through the contact page. Thank you for visiting!!! </P>
